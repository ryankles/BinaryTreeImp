Binary Search Tree Concepts Learned

1. Binary Tree Fundamentals
- Hierarchical node-based structure
- Each node has 0-2 children (left/right)
- Binary Search Tree property: left < parent ≤ right

2. Core Operations
- Insertion: Maintains BST property during adds
- Search: Efficient value lookup using tree hierarchy
- Deletion: Three case handling (0, 1, or 2 children)
- Traversals:
  * Inorder: Left → Root → Right (sorted order)
  * Preorder: Root → Left → Right (prefix notation)
  * Postorder: Left → Right → Root (postfix notation)

3. Memory Management
- Manual allocation/deallocation (new/delete)
- Recursive tree cleanup
- Pointer-based node connections

4. C++ Specific Concepts
- Template-based implementation
- Recursive algorithms
- Const-correct function design
- Proper header/implementation separation

5. Performance Analysis
- Average case O(log n) operations
- Worst case O(n) for unbalanced trees
- Importance of balancing in real-world use

6. Practical Applications
- Database indexing
- Filesystem hierarchies
- Network routing algorithms
- Game decision trees

Key Takeaways:
- Understanding tree recursion patterns
- Importance of proper memory management
- Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance
- Foundation for more advanced tree structures
